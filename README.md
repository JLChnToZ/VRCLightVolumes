# VRC Light Volumes
VRC Light Volumes is a nextgen voxel based light probes replacement for VRChat.

This is a free open-source asset, so if you like it, I would be very happy if you **[Support me on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/red_sim/ "Support me on Patreon")**.
There is a bunch of other cool assets you will get there!

## Main Features
- Baked per-pixel voxel based lighting
- Affects avatars and dynamic props (shader integration required)
- Fast and performant
- Can change color in runtime
- Can create cheap dynamic light sources that can be moved in runtime
- Works with dynamic batching, which potentially increases performance
- Works with Bakery or the default Unity Lightmapper
- Very easy and fast to setup
- It just looks beautiful!
